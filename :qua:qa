Refactored internal helpers with liberate

Replaced slice, reduce and own with the Function.liberate versions.

N.B., Since there isn't a full test suite, while I've tried to be careful
replacing the .call versions of each of these calls, there is a chance
of unnoticed regression here.  Merge at own risk.
